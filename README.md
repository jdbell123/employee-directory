## Reason

The reason for this assignment this week was to learn about using react. We were given the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria:

```md
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
```

## Take-Aways

This was a tough project as there were lots of new things going on in this one. My main take away from this assignment is to pay more attention to the details being taught in class and try and complete the assignments as soon as possible after class when it is still fresh in memory.
